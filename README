Text::Contraction version 0.01
==============================

Text::Contraction finds possible expansions for contractions.  For example,

	use Text::Contraction;

	my $cntrctn = Text::Contraction->new();
	my @matches = $cntrctn->match('abcde');

On my system this produces 'ambuscade' and 'absconded'.
